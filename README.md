Calendars for React v15.

Not just calendar component, but a modular toolkit for building everything
related to calendars in React, such as Datepickers.

In early alpha stage, documentation and features will arrive.

Example
-------

```
npm install
npm run
```

One year calendar ([Demo](http://freiksenet.github.io/react-calendar/)):

```html
<Calendar startDate={ moment() }
          endDate={ moment().endOf('year') } <!-- Base calendar component -->
          weekNumbers={true}
          size={12}
          mods={
            [                           <!-- Pass modifier objects to change rendering -->
              {
                date: moment(),
                classNames: [ 'current' ],
                component: [ 'day', 'month', 'week' ] <!-- This shows the current day, week, and month. -->
              }
            ]
          }

          />
```

Each component can be used separately ~~AND passed to other components to modify
rendering.~~ We have deprecated this in favor of passing a more flexible modifier object.

```html
<Month date={moment()} />
```

If a modifier is passed without date it modifies *all* components of this type in
the tree. Useful, for example, for passing callbacks.

```html
<Calendar firstMonth={1}
          date={moment("2014-01-01")}
          weekNumbers={true}
          size={12}
          startDate={ moment() }
          endDate={ moment().endOf('year') } <!-- Base calendar compoment -->
          weekNumbers={true}
          size={12}
          mods={
            [
              {
                component: [ 'day' ],
                events: {
                  onClick: (date) => alert(date)
                }
              }
            ]
          } />
```

Events
------

All mouse and touch events are supported on all components with react style
onCamelCase props (eg. onClick). Event handlers receives two arguments -
date in moment.js format and the original react event.

Styling
-------

There is no style by default, but an example theme using bootstrap is included
in less/bootstrap-theme.less.

react-calendar uses SuitCSS style (a variant of BEM) to make default class hierarchy,
if you want to add a class that is separate from that hierarchy just pass `classes`
prop to any component. `classes` is an object with keys as class names and values as
boolean-like values (this will be probably changed to just passing array of classes in
future API). If you want to add SuitCSS modifier classes (eg `rc-Day--current`),
pass similar object via `modifiers` prop (again this will probably become an array
in next version of API).

For example:

```html
<Day date={moment()} mods={[{bar: true}]} />
```

will yield the following classes: `"rc-Day rc-Day--bar".`

TODO
----

- [ ] Merging of modifiers and classe
- [ ] Docs
- [ ] Calendar should be able to page
- [ ] A component for Year - Calendar is supposed to be a 'controller' component for pageable stuff
- [ ] A component that is on lower level that Day - for events.
- [x] ~~Utils to create range of components for modifying multiple components easier~~
- [ ] An example datepicker component using react-calendar
- [x] ~~Basic unit tests~~
- [ ] More Tests!
